If you want to build the simplest flask app..

1. Get the file - `simplest_flask_app.py`, into some place in your local machine.
2. I am assuming Python is installed in your machine. *Run the below command* (in the below example, `simplest_flask_app.py` is inside C drive under Flask folder. You can change it to where you have placed `simplest_flask_app.py`. I have installed Anaconda on my machine, but you should be able to run it with a simple python.)

>`(base) C:\Flask>python simplest_flask_app.py`

3. Go to `http://localhost:5000/`, and you should see `Hello World!`.

There you go.
